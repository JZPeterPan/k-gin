Main Fig: The proposed k-space-based dynamic MR reconstruction framework consists of k-space Global Interpolation Network (k-GIN) and k-space Iterative Refinement Module (k-IRM) for refining the k-GIN interpolation. In the final
stage for the inference, we replace k-space estimation at the sampled position with ground-truth k-space values, ensuring the data consistency.

## Usage
Install environment and dependencies:
```python
conda create --name k_gin python=3.8
conda activate k_gin
pip install torch==1.13.0+cu116 torchvision==0.14.0+cu116 torchaudio==0.13.0 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu116
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To train the network: 
```python
python train.py --config config.yaml 
```
All the arguments and hyper-parameters can be adjusted in `config.yaml`. Since the applied data
of this work is confidential, users have to provide their own cardiac CINE data and undersampling 
masks. The corresponding data directory in `config.yaml` has to be uploaded accordingly.
